# Company Executive
You're the executive, who gives a shit about money?

Control how much money you start with, or just get infinite money each level.

Works in multiplayer, other players do not need the mod.

## Preferences

Enabled = Self explanatory.

ConsistentGive = If enabled, your money will be set every time the level changes. If disabled, it'll only be on the first day of the save.

MoneyToGive = Amount of money to get.

OverrideMoney = If enabled, your money will be set to the amount specified instead of added to. If disabled, it adds to your original starting money.
